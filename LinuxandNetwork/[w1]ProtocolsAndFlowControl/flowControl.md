## Flow Control 
* Ensure that the sender does not overwhelm the receiver by sending data too quickly .
* How does work ?   The sender sends one packet and waits for an ACK (acknowledgment) from the receiver before sending the next packet .
* If the receiver does not receive a packet, it will send a NACK (negative acknowledgment) .
* Sliding Window Flow Control
