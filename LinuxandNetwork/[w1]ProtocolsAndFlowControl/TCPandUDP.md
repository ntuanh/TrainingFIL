### TCP ( Transmission Control Protocol )
* Data transmission operating at the transport layer of the OSI model. 
* Connection-oriented protocol.
* Ensures reliable data transfer by using sequence numbers and acknowledgments.
* Uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection.
* Applications of TCP :
    * Web browsing (http and https )
    * Email (smtp and pop3)
    * File transfer (ftp)
* Slower and reliable .

### UDP ( User Datagram Protocol )
* Data transmission operating at the transport layer of the OSI model.
* Connectionless protocol.
* Does not ensure reliable data transfer.
* Does not use sequence numbers or acknowledgments.
* Applications of UDP :
    * Online gaming
    * Video streaming
    * Voice over IP (VoIP)
* Faster and less reliable .
