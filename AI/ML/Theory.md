## Machine Learning 
* Machine Learning - ML :
    - Is a branch of artificial intelligence ( AI ) .
    - Enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed.

* Types :
    - Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data (input-output pairs).
    - Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data.
    - Reinforcement Learning: Learns by trial and error, receiving rewards for good actions.

* Algorithms :
