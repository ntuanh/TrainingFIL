    "In this Lab, you will start by implementing logistic regression (for classification) and apply it to a dataset. Before starting, make sure that you read the slides of lecture 3.\n",
    "\n",

    "Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department and you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams. You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression.

You will build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based on the scores from those two exams.\n",

This array contains `True` if the corresponding value in `b` is `\"yes\"`, and `\"False\"` otherwise. Similarly, `b == \"no\"` will produce the boolean array `[False, False,  True, False,  True]`. Moreover, given an array of boolean values, e.g. `arr = [True,  True, False,  True, False]`, if we write `a[arr]` then we get `[\"This\", \"is\", \"interesting\"]`. This corresponds to the elements of `a` where the corresponding value in `arr` was `True`. In summary, to get the elements of a where the corresponding value in b is \"yes\", we can simply use `a[b == \"yes\"]`.\n",
